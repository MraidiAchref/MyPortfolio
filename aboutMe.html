                <h1>What is special in me ?</h1>
                <p id="intro-description"> After a fulfilling career as a physician, I have embraced the challenge of transitioning into 
                    the world of technology and am currently pursuing my studies in IT engineering. This unique journey has reinforced
                     my natural inclination towards responsibility and a serious work ethic. My passion lies in problem-solving,
                      a skill I honed in the medical field and am now applying to the intricate puzzles of the IT world.
                     The blend of these experiences has shaped me into a professional who thrives in dynamic, solution-focused environments</p>
